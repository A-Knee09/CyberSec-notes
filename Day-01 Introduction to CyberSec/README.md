# DAY-01 Introduction to Cyber Security üê±‚Äçüíª

This README file contains the fundamentals of cybersecurity based on the notes I‚Äôve made. Cybersecurity is essential in today‚Äôs digital world to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of systems and networks against various threats.

## What is Cyber Security üîê

- **Cybersecurity** is the ***practice*** of protecting ***systems, networks, and data*** from digital threats like hacking, malware, and unauthorized access. It encompasses measures such as network security, information protection, endpoint security, and application security.
  
- Key components include identity and access management, incident response, and disaster recovery planning. Cybersecurity ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, safeguarding against breaches and ensuring compliance with regulations to maintain secure and resilient IT environments.

- Cyber attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information.

## Types of Cybersecurity Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are numerous types of cybersecurity attacks, each targeting different aspects of systems and networks for various intents and purposes. Common types include:

### 1. Phishing üé£

- A phishing attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker impersonates a legitimate entity, typically through email, messaging, or a fake website, to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. This information can include passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details.

- Phishing attacks often appear as urgent or important messages, such as a security alert from a bank or a request from a familiar contact.

### 2. Malware üíªü™±

- **Malware**, short for "malicious software," is any software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise a computer system or network. This includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal data, damage files, or give unauthorized access to attackers.

### 3. Ransomware üö´

- **Ransomware** is a type of malicious software (malware) that ***encrypts a victim's data or locks them out of their system***, making it inaccessible. The attacker then demands a ransom payment, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for a decryption key or restoring access to the system.

- Ransomware attacks often spread through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software. If the ransom is not paid, the attacker may threaten to delete the data permanently or make it publicly available. Even if the ransom is paid, there's no guarantee that the data will be restored.

- Ransomware attackers use cryptocurrencies because they provide anonymity, making transactions hard to trace. Cryptocurrencies are also not controlled by banks, so attackers can move money easily across countries without getting caught, avoiding regulations.

  > WannaCry was a 2017 ransomware attack that spread rapidly across the globe, exploiting a Windows vulnerability. It encrypted data on infected systems, demanding Bitcoin payments for decryption, causing widespread disruption.

### 4. Social Engineering üé≠

- **Social engineering** is a ***manipulation technique*** that exploits human behavior to gain private access, information, or valuables.

- Techniques include phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating, and impersonation, focusing on exploiting trust and behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities.

### 5. Man-in-the-Middle üîÑ

- A **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker positions themselves between the sender and receiver, gaining access to the data being exchanged.

  Key aspects include:

  - **Interception**: The attacker captures the data being transmitted between the parties.
  - **Decryption**: If encryption is used, the attacker may decrypt the data to read or modify it.
  - **Manipulation**: The attacker can alter the data or inject malicious content before forwarding it to the intended recipient.
  
  MitM attacks can occur in various scenarios, such as intercepting network communications on insecure Wi-Fi, exploiting flaws in web protocols, or manipulating communications in online transactions. The goal is often to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.

### 6. Zero-Day Attack ‚è±Ô∏è

- A **zero-day attack** exploits a previously unknown software or hardware vulnerability. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that the flaw is exploited before the developer is aware of it and before a patch is available.

- Zero-day attacks are particularly dangerous and difficult to defend against due to the lack of a known fix or mitigation.

## Conclusion

These notes provide a foundational understanding of cybersecurity and the various types of threats that organizations and individuals may face. The ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity requires continuous learning and adaptation to protect against emerging threats and ensure a secure digital environment.
